# <h1 style="text-align: center;">DATA ANALYSIS WITH PYTHON</h1>

# <h3>IMPORTS</h3><p>Matplotlib is the most popular plotting package for python. Pandas is a python library used mainly for data manipulation and analysis. Pyplot is a collection of command style functions that enhance the work of matplotlib.NumPy is a python package used for scientific computing.SciPy is a python library used for scientific and technical computing. SciPy basically uses NumPy for more mathematical functions.<p>

# In[1]:


import pandas as pd
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
from scipy.stats import ttest_ind
import numpy as np


# <h3>CREATING A PANDAS DATAFRAME FROM A DATASET</h3>
# <p>I import the dataset on the economic characteristics of Jersey city in 2013 which is in csv format and assign it to the new variable jersey.The data contains 3 columns showing the year, title_field and value, each of which has numerous variables.</p>

# In[2]:


jersey = pd.read_csv("acs-jersey-city-economic-characteristics-2013-1.csv")


# In[3]:


jersey


# <h3>Filtering Data</h3><p>The current dataframe displays the variables that I plan to focus on for this project  which are: Median Household Income and the Median Gross Rent.<p>

# In[4]:


income = jersey[jersey.title_field == 'Median household income']
rent = jersey[jersey.title_field == 'Median gross rent']


# In[5]:


print("Income data :\n")
print(income)

print("Rent data :\n")
print(rent)


# <h3>Summary Statistics</h3><p>In my analysis,I assign the 'Median household income' and 'Median gross rent' variables to new variables namely: income and rent respectively.I then use the describe() function which computes a summary of statistics pertaining to the DataFrame columns to obtain the Mean, Standard deviation and Interquartile Range values of my variables.<p>

# In[6]:


rent.describe()


# In[7]:


income.describe()


# <h3>Data Visualization</h3><b>Line Graph</b><p>Data Visualization is usually the first step of any work involving data analysis. Creating visualizations really helps in making things clearer and easier to understand.Line charts are best used when you can clearly see that one variable varies greatly with another i.e they have a high covariance. In the first graph, the year associated with the income is plotted on the x-axis while the values associated with the varibale income are plotted on the y-axis while in the second graph,the year associated with the rent is plotted on the x-axis while the values associated with the rent varibale income are plotted on the y-axis<p>

# In[8]:


plt.plot (income.year, income.value)
plt.title ("Median Household Income")
plt.xlabel("Year")
plt.ylabel("Value")
plt.show()


# In[9]:


plt.plot (rent.year, rent.value)
plt.title ("Median Gross Rent")
plt.xlabel("Year")
plt.ylabel("Value")
plt.show()


# <h3>Plotting on same axes</h3><p>I was further interested in plotting both the variables income and rent on the same chart.The values associated with the variable income were very high compared to the values associated with the rent variable so I divided the income values by 50 to have a more presentable visualization.<p>

# In[10]:


plt.plot (income.year, income.value/50)
plt.plot (rent.year, rent.value)
plt.title ("Median Household Income vs Median Gross Rent")
plt.xlabel("Year")
plt.ylabel("Value")
plt.legend(["Median Household Income","Median Gross Rent"])
plt.show()


# <h3>Bar Graph<h3/>

# In[11]:


plt.bar (income.year, income.value/50,align='center',alpha=0.5, color=['cyan'])
plt.xticks(income.year)
plt.ylabel('Value')
plt.title('Median Household Income')

plt.show()


# In[12]:


plt.bar(income.year, rent.value, alpha=0.8,color=['red'])
plt.xticks(rent.year)
plt.ylabel('Value')
plt.title('Median Gross Rent')

plt.show()


# In[13]:


plt.bar (income.year, income.value/50, -0.4 , align='edge',alpha=0.5,color=['cyan'])
plt.bar (income.year, rent.value, 0.4 , align='edge', alpha=0.8,color=['red'])
plt.xticks(income.year)
plt.xticks(rent.year)
plt.ylabel('Value')
plt.title('Median Household Income vs Median Gross Rent')
plt.legend(["Median Household Income","Median Gross Rent"], bbox_to_anchor=(1.0, 1.0))


plt.show()


# <h3>Measuring Statistics</h3><p>I compute the mean and standard values of the income and rent variable by calling numpy and print the results<p>

# In[14]:


income_mean = np.mean(income)
rent_mean = np.mean(rent)

print("income mean value:\n",income_mean)
print("rent mean value:\n",rent_mean)


# In[15]:


income_std = np.std(income)
rent_std = np.std(rent)

print("income standard value:\n",income_std)
print("rent standard value:\n",rent_std)


# <h3>Hypothesis Testing</h3><p>Using the Scipy library, I carry out a statistics test to find out if the data between the Median Household Income and the Median Household Rent is significant. I use a T-Test of Independece which is the test used for the means of two independent samples. The null hypothesis in my study is that the Median Household Income and the Median Household Rent have identical average values and I'm hoping to either reject or accept it based off the results of my p-value.A p-value helps you determine the significance of your results when you perform a hypothesis test.If we reject the null hypothesis, the results are considered significant. <p>

# In[16]:


ttest,pval = ttest_ind(income['value'], rent['value'])
print("The p-value is",pval)

if pval < 0.05:
  print("We reject the null hypothesis")
else:
  print("We accept the null hypothesis")
